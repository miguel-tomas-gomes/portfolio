            <h1>Miguel Tomás Gomes</h1>
            <p class="bio-role">UX Writer</p>
            <p class="bio-location">Based in Lisbon, Portugal</p>
            
            <div class="bio-story">
              <p>I've always been captivated by how words can reframe how we see the world. This fascination naturally drew me to Linguistics, where I dove deep into the mechanics of language.</p>
              
              <p>When I transitioned into tech companies, I realized I was sitting at the intersection of two worlds I loved: the precision of language and the complexity of technology. I found myself genuinely excited by system architectures and user flows.</p>
              
              <p>What truly transformed my approach was discovering the power of data-driven decisions. In a field where everyone has opinions about what "sounds better," data became my compass.</p>
              
              <p>Whether it's through quantitative testing or qualitative research, I pair my intuition with empirical evidence as a strong foundation for decision making.</p>
              
              <p>Outside of work, you'll find me wandering through Lisbon's neighborhoods. I'm also passionate about analog photography. You could say there's a beautiful parallel between getting the perfect shot and crafting the perfect string of UX copy: both require patience, intention, and looking past the obvious.</p>
