        <section>
          <p>Sometimes UX writing has to bridge the gap between deeply technical processes and the people asked to use them. Domain configuration was one of those cases.</p>
          
          <h2>Context</h2>
	  <p>As one of the UX writers at a fast-moving low-code software company, I was asked to design the experience for customers setting up custom domains. On the surface, this sounded straightforward. It seemed like a simple process of walking users through adding and verifying a domain. In practice, it turned out to be far more complex.</p>
	  <p>The Product Designer assigned to the feature was unavailable, as was the case with the Product Manager. I was left with vague directions and no clear blueprint for how the flow should work.</p>
          
          <h3>From Uncertainty to Clarity</h3>
	  <p>Without a plan to fall back on, I took the lead. I had no background in DNS records, CNAMEs, or SSL validation, so I started with research. I read up on the basics, then sat down with a Cloud Architect stakeholder and a few backend developers to understand the technical requirements. Their explanations gave me the grounding I needed to write with confidence.</p>
	  <p>With that foundation in place, I partnered with another Designer who happened to be available. Together we began shaping the experience into a step-by-step flow that would feel effortless for users, even if the underlying process was highly technical.</p>
          
          <h3>The Technical Process</h3>
	  <p>For customers to connect a custom domain, they needed to add their domain to the platform, verify ownership by adding a CNAME record, point the domain to their application with a second CNAME, and then ensure SSL validation completed within 72 hours to avoid expiration.</p>
	  <p>The trouble was that only more advanced users were familiar with DNS or SSL concepts.</p>
	  <p>On top of that, the 72-hour window for SSL validation was critical. If users missed it, they had to start the process over.</p>
	  <p>Instead of piling more jargon into the UI, we set out to design a flow that guided users through these constraints without overwhelming them.</p>
          
          <h2>The Approach</h2>
	  <p>The key was to reduce cognitive load. We divided the flow into three distinct steps—add a domain, validate ownership, and point the domain.</p>
	  <p>This ensured that users only had to focus on one action at a time. Each step was framed in plain language and anchored by a clear goal.</p>

	  <p>Usability testing on low-fidelity mockups revealed that some users were unfamiliar with SSL certificates but reacted well to the word security. That insight informed a critical shift. Instead of "SSL certificate," we told users: "A security certificate was issued for this domain. This certificate will expire in 72 hours. Follow the next steps to complete the setup before expiration."</p>
	  <p>This wording simplified the concept, highlighted the time constraint, and focused attention on the next action.</p>

          <h3>Guiding Users Through Uncertainty</h3>
	  <p>The same principle applied to expired states. Originally, users who missed the 72-hour window were left staring at a system message that offered no path forward. We replaced it with: "The security certificate for this domain has expired. To reuse this domain, delete it and add it again."</p>
	  <p>This avoided blame, stated the issue in clear terms, and gave users a direct recovery path. We also added helpful empty states at key points.</p>
	      <img src="../assets/domain-journey.png" alt="screen showing domain journey" class="article-image-spaced" />
        <p>When no domain had been added yet, the interface clearly explained why the section was blank and how to get started. When a certificate expired, the message no longer left users guessing, but guided them to resolution.</p>

        <p>We also added confirmation modals for users attempting to leave the configuration before completion. This prevented certificate expiration and gave users a chance to reconsider.</p>

        <h2>Outcome</h2>
	  <p>The new copy and structure made the domain configuration process less intimidating and far easier to complete.</p>
	  <p>Customers no longer felt blocked by technical jargon or hidden deadlines. The product gained a consistent voice in error states and flows, aligning with our conversational tone.</p>
          
          <h2>Results</h2>
	  <p>In usability tests, participants reported that the flow felt more approachable and easier to follow. Users were now able to complete the configuration with minimal guidance.</p>
          <p>Support data backed this up. Tickets related to SSL and DNS setup dropped by about 31% in the weeks following the rollout, giving the support team space to focus on more complex technical issues.</p>
          <p>By restructuring the flow into simple steps we turned a fragile, failure-prone process into a guided experience. It was a reminder that even in highly technical features, words carry the weight of the experience.</p>
